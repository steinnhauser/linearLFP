# LFP Kernel Estimation BaS network

Package repository for estimating the LFP signal of a neuroscience system using the kernel method. Included are multiple scripts for kernel generation, kernel use, and illustration.

Note that some directories are required for output and that the x86_64 neuron models must be compiled.
Use:

```
./sim.sh 12.8 1 run_name
```
where 12.8 is the population scale factor, 1 is the NIDX scale (external drive multiple) and run_name is the run ID.
